# Celebrity Influence Analysis

In this project we have performed an analysis of the influence of the top 10 most followed celebrities in the world on instagram.

To beign with we have selected the two sources for our data one of them is Reddit and other one is YouTube. We could not include X (Twitter) since they do not allow data gathering using their API any more.

So we first setup the code to crawl each website and then get the data and store them in mongoDB. After that we start with performing our analysis.

We have performed the following analysis here.
  - Sentiments Analysis
  - Trend Analysis
  - Infulence Matrics
